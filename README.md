# criptoSGR

This was an individual project made in a Networks Management and Security class, to apply the knowledges of the openssl utility and create a shell script with a UI, using [Xdialog](http://xdialog.free.fr).

## Project Proposal

Create a shell script that let's the user manage his SSH Keys and making possible to build some key operations, like:

- Asymmetric keys generation;
- Symmetric key distribution;
- Message encription (with different algorithms, e.g. DES, DES3, AES256, Blowfish);
- Hash generation;
- Assignature;
- Verification;

## Requirements

- Linux distribution;
- Understand portuguese. The output is all in portuguese.

If you can read portuguese, the project sheet is on the resources folder.
